Big O Noatation is the noatation used to describe the worst case scenario of the code.

This is used for many other things i.e., to compare different different code by using same method to compare

one of the best time complexity of the searching algorithm is O(log n)


other complexity:

O(log n)  <  O(n)  <  O(n log n)  <  O(n^2)  <  O(n!)
